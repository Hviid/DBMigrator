## What problem does DbMigrator try to solve
There are two different ways of handling database deploy: State and migration

### Migration based
A lot of frameworks have migrations build in. But the problems seems to be that they only support 
a subset of the functionality we need. Typically only schemas and indexes.
For example Entity framework have migrations baked in, but it only supports schema and index migrations.
Though you can write your own migrations in pure SQL and put them next to the autogenerated files. 
This are though not desireble for us.

### State based
Microsoft has SQL Server Data Tools(SSDT) which support a state based approach. 
The problem with state based approach are if we want to do some kind of data migrations in a release. 
This is possible i SSDT, but the data migration get "bound" to that release. 
So if you update your database more then 1 release, you have to apply all the release between sequantially.
This are neither desireble.

### Why DBMigrator
Based on the above we choose to go the Migration based path.

## How it works
DBMigrator works 

## Features
* Validation

   TO DO hash validation
* Diff
* Upgrade
* Rollback

## DBMigrator

### Folder structure and scripts
Folder structure is as follows: 

    <ReleaseVersion>/<Feature>/Migrations/

Example:

    1.00/US_12345/Migrations/

Note that DBMigrator should be at the same place as \<ReleaseVersion\> folder.

Script files should be named as follows:

	<order>_<name>.sql

Example:

	1_Test.sql

Rollback script files should be named as follows:

	<order>_rollback_<name>.sql

Example:

	1_rollback_Test.sql

### Create new version
Run DBMigrator with parameters like follows:

    -newversion "$version"


This creates a new folder with "$version" as name in the folder where the executable 
are located.

### Create new feature
Run DBMigrator with parameters like follows:

    NewFeature.ps1 "$newfeaturename"

This creates a new folder with "$newfeaturename" as name in the folder 
where "NewFeature.ps1" are located.

Inside this folder are the following folder structure:
*  Migrations
*  Migrate



### Upgrade database
Run DBMigrator with parameters like follows:

    upgrade -v "$toVersionString" -s "$servername" -d "$database" -u "$username" -p "$password"

Where "-v" is optional and will default be the latest version.

### Downgrade database
Run DBMigrator with parameters like follows:

    downgrade -v "$toVersionString" -s "$servername" -d "$database" -u "$username" -p "$password"
